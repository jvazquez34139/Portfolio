            | My goal is to be a full-stack javascript developer. I enjoy working on back-end apps as well as front-end. 
            | I started learning to code in the summer before my sophomore year at high school. 
            | Game development really caught my eye that year since I was a PC gamer at the time.
            | I've always been self-driven to learn everything I need to start developing useful apps that I too can benefit from.
